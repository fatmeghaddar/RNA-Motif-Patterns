Codes and Data files used inside the research paper "Random and natural non-coding RNA have similar structural motif patterns but differ in bulge, loop, and bond counts".



The process of getting the RNA natural samples is explained in details within the Methods section within the paper.
The codes attached should be run with the data files placed inside the respiratory. 
1. Vienna package and SecStruc package should be downloaded inside the laptop device.
2. The natural RNA samples used are downloaded from RNACentral website, cleaned by excluding junks and repeated sequences, then folded using Vienna package.
3. Random samples are generated using the code placed within this respiratory.
